Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

Styles should always be indepent of each other. "Specific"
Stylesheet can access "Shared" stylesheets.

Import order in final CSS:

- settings
- partials/shared
- partials/specific

Place your files with display size name
in subfolders, e.g. partials/specific/home/_medium-up.scss
They will be automatically imported

/*
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
These are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.

IMPORTANT: All styles should be independent of each other. If you want to share or extend elements,
try to make them fit in a stylesheet in the shared folder since it will be imported first.
